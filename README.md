# Push-swap
> "This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an optimized data sorting."

## Introduction
The main objective of the "push swap" project is to develop a sorting algorithm that uses the provided operations to rearrange the given list of numbers in the minimum number of moves. You'll be working with constraints on memory usage and optimizing for speed, making this project a comprehensive test of your coding and algorithmic skills.

## Strategy
- Understand the problem and constraints;
- Choose a sorting strategy to use as the basis for the push swap algorithm;
- Plan your algorithm;
- Implement the algorithm using the stack operations;
- Test the chosen algorithm;
- Optimize and refine;
- Iterate and improve (until satisfied);
- Handle special cases;
- Documentation and clean the code;
- Final testing (large inputs) and make sure it meets the project requirements.

## Topics to study:

# Push-swap
> "This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an optimized data sorting."

## Introduction
The main objective of the "push swap" project is to develop a sorting algorithm that uses the provided operations to rearrange the given list of numbers in the minimum number of moves. You'll be working with constraints on memory usage and optimizing for speed, making this project a comprehensive test of your coding and algorithmic skills.

## Strategy
- **Understand the problem and constraints** (allowed operations, limitations on the number of operations and range of input, ...);
- **Choose a sorting strategy** to use as the basis for the push swap algorithm;
- **Plan your algorithm** (break down the chosen algorithm into steps that can be achieved using the allowed stack operations);
- **Implement the algorithm** using the stack operations (swaps, pushes, rotates and reverse rotates);
- **Test the chosen algorithm** (with various input sizes and configurations);
- **Optimize and refine**;
- **Iterate and improve** (until satisfied);
- **Handle special cases** (eg. small number elements);
- **Documentation and clean the code**;
- **Final testing** (large inputs) and make sure it meets the project requirements.

## Topics to study:
- Sorting Algorithms;
- Data Structures -Stacks;
- Time and Space Complexity (how long an algorithm takes to run and how much memory an algorithm uses);
- Big O Notation (runtime complexity of an algorithm);
- Divide and Conquer technique (breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems, solving them, and then combining the solutions);
- Greedy Algorithms (understanding this concept will be useful for other problems);
- Dynamic Programming technique (solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems);
- Space and Time Trade-offs (using more memory to achieve faster runtime and vice versa);
- Practice and Implementation (coding exercises on platforms like LeetCode, Codewars, HackerRank, or CodeSignal)
- Project-Specific Topics (understand the allowed operations, the constraints, and how to simulate stack operations using arrays or linked lists).
